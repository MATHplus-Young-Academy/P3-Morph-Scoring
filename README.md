# Morphological Scoring of Disease States
Obtain a classifier system that takes the non-Euclidean structure of shape spaces into account. The statistical shape model based approach [Ambellan et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841521002243?via%3Dihub) will serve as a starting point. Possible extensions include different metrics, advanced Riemannian mean-variance analysis, robust estimators, and intrinsic machine learning approaches.
